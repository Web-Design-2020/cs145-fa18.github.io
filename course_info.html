      <p><b>Overview</b>
        This course covers database design and the use of databases in applications, with a short introduction to the internals of
        relational database engines. It includes extensive coverage of the relational model, relational algebra, and SQL.
        The course also features database design and relational design principles based on dependencies and normal forms.
        Many additional key database topics from the design and application-building perspective are also covered, including
        indexes, views, transactions, and integrity constraints. Systems such as MapReduce framework and key-value stores
        will also be covered. A key part of the course is hands-on programming project in SQL+Python, where you will query,
        visualize and predict from terabytes of data on BigQuery, a popular cloud database.
